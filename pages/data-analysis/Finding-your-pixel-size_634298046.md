As long as you have your raw data and it was taken in the CALM it should
be a.ome.tif,.nd2, or.dv file. These steps below will also work with
any file *as long as the metadata has properly been recorded.*

Prerequisite: Download and open fiji
([https://fiji.sc/](https://fiji.sc/))

- Step1: Open the Bio-Format Plugins Shortcut Window
 - [
- Step2: Drag and drop your file on the shortcut window\
 \*Or you can open from Bio-Format Importer
 - [
- Step3: Click 'OK' from the window below\
 \*'Display OME XML metadata' will show you the pixel\
 size embedded in the image\
 \*'Use virtual stack' (red arrow) will help with opening\
 up large sized z stack images faster!
 - [
- In the OME Metadata window
 - You can double check the pixel size from this window (red arrow)\
 \*This is just an example screenshot
