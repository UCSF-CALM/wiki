[The previous NIC Data
server](The-previous-NIC-Data-server_685901387.html)

\

The CALM file server at
**[mic.ucsf.edu](http://mic.ucsf.edu)**.

\

The CALM has a new file server.  It has more capacity than the old one
(\~870TB) and reading and writing should be much faster, especially from
within the NIC with computers on our local high-speed network.

**Do not rely on the file server as your only source of your data! In no
way can we be held responsible for loss of data from the file server.
Moreover, data older than 3 months will be automatically deleted. **

\

Before your can use the server, **your PI needs to give approval** by
taking this [this
survey.](https://ucsf.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_exhElckuEg2gi2i)  Then, request access
from [nico.stuurman@ucsf.edu](mailto:nico.stuurman@ucsf.edu).  Please send your short UCSF user name (for me, that is
"nstuurman").

\

The server can only be used from within the UCSF network.  When you are
outside, connect through VPN first.

To mount the server from a Windows computer, open a File Explorer, and
find "This PC"

\

[

\

Right click and Select "Map Network Drive".

For "Folder" enter
\\\\[mic.ucsf.edu](http://mic.ucsf.edu)\\yourShortUserName

Uncheck "Reconnect at sign-in, and check "Connect using different
credentials".

\

[

\

On the next screen, for "User name" type: "campus\\yourShortUserName",
and your UCSF password. Make sure that "Remember my credentials" is not
checked (on shared computers).

[

\

Note that you have your own personal space here.  As long as you are
within the UCSF network you can reach the
[mic.ucsf.edu](http://mic.ucsf.edu)  file
server.

**Please disconnect the drive when you are done using it, especially on
a shared computer.**

\

** **From Mac:

1. In the Finder go to Go → Connect to Sever

2. Enter [smb://mic.ucsf.edu](smb://mic.ucsf.edu){rel="nofollow"}

3. Enter CAMPUS in the Workgroup/Domain field and the your UCSF short
 username and password.
