### Commercial Software available at the CALM

- [NIS-Elements](https://www.microscope.healthcare.nikon.com/products/software/nis-elements) - Nikon\'s image acquisition and analysis software.
 The same software we use to run most of the microscopes, this is also
 an easy-to-use tool for routine data analysis.
- [MATLAB](MATLAB_517184427.html) - A popular commercial programming
 language and interactive environment for data analysis. Useful links
 to microscopy tools for Matlab are collected here.
- [Huygens](Huygens_517184442.html) - Huygens is a powerful and easy to
 use deconvolution program.
- [Slidebook](https://www.intelligent-imaging.com/slidebook) - 3i commercial software package for image acquisition
 and analysis.

### Free Software

- [ImageJ and Variants](ImageJ-and-Variants_517184301.html) - One of the
 most commonly used free image analysis programs. Has a large and
 active development community.
- [Nikon
 Viewer](https://www.microscope.healthcare.nikon.com/products/software/nis-elements/viewer) - Free viewer for Nikon\'s file formats.
- [CellProfiler](https://cellprofiler.org/) - A free, open source image analysis tool designed for
 analysis of image-based screens.
- [Allen Cell Explorer](https://www.allencell.org/) - Resources from Allen Institute for Cell Science.
 Includes the Cell Feature Explorer, Cell Catalog, and Allen Cell
 Structure Segmenter.
- [Napari](https://napari.org/) -
 Multi-dimensional image viewer for python
- [IOCBioMicroscope](https://github.com/pearu/iocbio/wiki/IOCBioMicroscope) - A free, open source Lucy-Richardson deconvolution
 tool, written in Python.
- [Farsight
 Toolkit](http://farsight-toolkit.ee.uh.edu/wiki/Main_Page) - Sophisticated packages for image alignment,
 segmentation, and neuron / vessel tracing, among other things.
- [Ilastik](https://www.ilastik.org/)-
 [Machine learning algorithms to segment, classify, track and count
 your cells or other experimental
 data.]
 - [Use ilastik and cell profiler together! Check out the [Cell
 Profiler and Ilastik: Superpowered segmentation blog
 entry](https://carpenter-singh-lab.broadinstitute.org/blog/cellprofiler-ilastik-superpowered-segmentation) and the [How to use Pixel Classification in Cell
 Profile](https://github.com/CellProfiler/CellProfiler/wiki/How-to-use-Pixel-Classification-in-CellProfiler)[r](https://github.com/CellProfiler/CellProfiler/wiki/How-to-use-Pixel-Classification-in-CellProfiler), which has important instructions for the export of
 images from ilastik to get them into Cell
 Profiler!]
