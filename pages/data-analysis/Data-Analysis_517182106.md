  language and interactive environment for data analysis. Useful links
  to microscopy tools for Matlab are collected here.
- [Huygens](Huygens_517184442.html) - Huygens is a powerful and easy to
  use deconvolution program.
- [Slidebook](https://www.intelligent-imaging.com/slidebook){.external-link
