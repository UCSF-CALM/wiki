# ImageJ and Variants

### Distributions

[ImageJ](https://imagej.net/) is one of
the older free, open source image analysis programs. Alone, it\'s not
that powerful; it\'s real strength is the vast array of plugins for it.
It runs on Windows, Mac, and Linux.

[FIJI](http://fiji.sc "http://fiji.sc")
is probably the best distribution of ImageJ for routine data analysis.
It comes with a vast array of plugins already installed and ready to use
and has an automatic updater so you always have the latest versions of
them.

[Micro-Manager](http://www.micro-manager.org/ "http://www.micro-manager.org/") is a microscope control package that is built on top of
ImageJ. It\'s developed at UCSF and is very powerful; we use it to
control the Spinning Disk Confocal in the Nikon Imaging Center.

### Plugins

The following plugins may be of particular interest to our users:

[Bioformats](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/)- Software tool to open files from a variety of formats.
This plugin will allow you to open nd2 files in ImageJ/FIJI.

[SIMcheck](https://www.micron.ox.ac.uk/software/SIMcheck/)- Plugin for assessing the quality and reliability of
Structured Illumination Microscopy data. This plugin is useful for
anyone doing SIM imaging to watch for artifacts and other problems with
your data.

 Super-resolution Structured Illumination Microscopy. Scientific
 Reports 5, Article number: 15915

[ClearVolume](ClearVolume_701467993.html) - 3D volume viewer. the easy
install is listed here along with the quick fix for the rendering
issue.


### Forums

[Image.sc](https://forum.image.sc/) -
Community forum for multiple open-source image analysis software
packages where you can find answer to common problems and post questions
to the community. The forum is very active and you can get help quickly.

[Microforum](https://forum.microlist.org/)- Community forum based on hardware, acquisition, and
specimen-related question.
