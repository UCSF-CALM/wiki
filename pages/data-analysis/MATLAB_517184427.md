Matlab is a very popular commercial programming language and interactive
environment for data analysis in biology, particularly in microscopy.
I\'ll collect up useful Matlab links here.

- You can use
  [Bioformats](https://www.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/){.external-link
  rel="nofollow"} to load nd2 images in Matlab. [Here\'s
  how.](https://docs.openmicroscopy.org/bio-formats/6.5.1/users/matlab/index.html)

- You can also access Micro-Manager through Matlab. [See
  here](https://micro-manager.org/wiki/Matlab){.external-link
  rel="nofollow"} for more info.

- Kurt publishes Matlab code for image analysis at
  [Github](https://github.com/kthorn/ "https://github.com/kthorn/"){.external-link
