title: Cilia Analysis
author: Herrington, Kari

We have had a number of people analyze Cilia in the Core and ask us
questions about how to analyze their cilia, primarily in terms of
segmenting then measuring

\

### NIS Elements 

- A popular method inspired by this
  paper: [https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8791558/](https://pmc.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/articles/PMC8791558/){.external-link

- Easy to use and get set up on
- The basics is to Train with the Elements Ai (pixel-based machine
  learning), then analyze with a pipeline in the software
- Great for segmenting in 2D or 3D, then measuring fluorescence/size and
  shape

### CiliaQ 

- [CiliaQ: a simple, open-source software for automated quantification
  of ciliary morphology and fluorescence in 2D, 3D, and 4D images -

- Recommended by our specialist Micaela Lasser who used it in her
  paper! [Ciliary biology intersects autism and congenital heart
  disease -
