# Monthly Microscopy Users Meeting

#### [Microscopy References and
 Education](Microscopy-References-and-Education.html)

In order to try and build a sense of community among the microscopists
at UCSF and catalyze the exchange of information between the various
people doing microscopy here, a monthly microscopy users group meeting
has started. The goal of this meeting is to provide an informal setting
for people to talk about the microscopy aspects of their work. As there
are currently many forums to talk about the science being done, this new
forum is where people could discuss the technical aspects of their work,
which often are left out when talking about the science. This meeting to
be open to all types of microscopy being done at UCSF. If you are
interested in speaking, send an email to Alice
(myo.thwin@[ucsf.edu](http://ucsf.edu))
and she will schedule you in. Attendance is open to all at UCSF.
