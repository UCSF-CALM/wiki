# Books, Websites, Etc

#### [Microscopy References and
 Education](Microscopy-References-and-Education.html)

#### General Microscopy

Michael Davidson maintains an excellent family of websites, many
sponsored by manufacturers, which are an excellent source of microscopy
information:

- [Molecular
 Expressions](http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/index.html "http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/index.html")

- [Nikon Microscopy
 U](http://www.microscopyu.com/ "http://www.microscopyu.com/")

- [Zeiss MicroImaging
 Campus](http://zeiss-campus.magnet.fsu.edu/index.html/ "http://zeiss-campus.magnet.fsu.edu/index.html/")

- [Olympus Microscopy Resouce
 Center](http://www.olympusmicro.com/ "http://www.olympusmicro.com/")

- [Hamamatsu Learning
 Center](https://hamamatsu.magnet.fsu.edu/)

#### Fluorescent Probes

- [The Molecular Probes
 Handbook](http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/References/Molecular-Probes-The-Handbook.html "http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/References/Molecular-Probes-The-Handbook.html") - a good source of information on fluorescent dyes and
 small molecule reporters.

- [openoptogenetics](http://www.openoptogenetics.org/index.php?title=Main_Page) - Optogenetics wiki site with good technical
 information

- [FPbase](https://www.fpbase.org/)- a
 good source of information on fluorescent proteins. Spectra viewer
 also useful for comparison of filter sets between different
 fluorescent proteins.

#### Data Analysis

- John Maloney has a very nice presentation on statistics and data
 analysis from the MIT IAP:
 [Maloney.pdf](http://web.mit.edu/vvgroup/Maloney%20-%20Topics%20in%20statistics%20%28MIT%202010%20IAP%29.pdf)

- A nice primer on image analysis in ImageJ/Fiji: [Analyzing
 fluorescence microscopy
 images](http://www.microscopist.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2018/09/ImageJ_FL_Image_Analysis.pdf)

 packages where you can find answer to common problems and post
 questions to the community. The forum is very active and you can get
 help quickly.

- [Microforum](https://forum.microlist.org/)- Community forum based on hardware, acquisition, and
 specimen-related question.

### Recommended Books on Microscopy

[Fundamentals of Light Microscopy and Electronic
Imaging](http://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Light-Microscopy-Electronic-Imaging/dp/047125391X/ "http://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Light-Microscopy-Electronic-Imaging/dp/047125391X/"), Douglas B. Murphy: A good general purpose introduction
to commonly used microscopy techniques, including fluorescence, phase
contrast and DIC, and brief discussions of confocal microscopy and
cameras.

[Handbook of Biological Confocal Microscopy, 3rd
ed.](http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Biological-Confocal-Microscopy-Pawley/dp/038725921X/ "http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Biological-Confocal-Microscopy-Pawley/dp/038725921X/"), James Pawley, ed.: This is the book to get if you want
an in-depth understanding of not just confocal microscopy, but the whole
diversity of modern microscopy techniques. It\'s not a good introduction
to the subject but it is a fantastic reference work with lots and lots
of technical detail.
