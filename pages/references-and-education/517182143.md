### Recommended Books on Microscopy

[Fundamentals of Light Microscopy and Electronic
Imaging](http://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Light-Microscopy-Electronic-Imaging/dp/047125391X/ "http://www.amazon.com/Fundamentals-Light-Microscopy-Electronic-Imaging/dp/047125391X/"){.external-link
rel="nofollow"}, Douglas B. Murphy: A good general purpose introduction
to commonly used microscopy techniques, including fluorescence, phase
contrast and DIC, and brief discussions of confocal microscopy and
cameras.

[Handbook of Biological Confocal Microscopy, 3rd
ed.](http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Biological-Confocal-Microscopy-Pawley/dp/038725921X/ "http://www.amazon.com/Handbook-Biological-Confocal-Microscopy-Pawley/dp/038725921X/"){.external-link
rel="nofollow"}, James Pawley, ed.: This is the book to get if you want
an in-depth understanding of not just confocal microscopy, but the whole
diversity of modern microscopy techniques. It\'s not a good introduction
to the subject but it is a fantastic reference work with lots and lots
of technical detail.
