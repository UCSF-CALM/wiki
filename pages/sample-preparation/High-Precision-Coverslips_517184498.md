Microscope objectives, in general, are designed to work with 0.17 mm
coverslips. You will get the best image quality using coverslips of
exactly this thickness. Using coverslips of the wrong thickness will
induce [spherical
aberration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_aberration "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_aberration"){.external-link

There are now a number of sources for high precision (0.17 +/- 0.005 mm)
coverslips:

- [Azer
  Scientific](https://www.azerscientific.com/life-sciences/glassware-plasticware/cover-glasses/specialty?page=1){.external-link

- [Zeiss](https://www.micro-shop.zeiss.com/en/de/shop/search/Cover%20glasses,%20high%20performance,){.external-link

Suppliers (these don\'t sell direct, but might be useful for finding
other distributors:

- [Schott](https://www.us.schott.com/advanced_optics/english/products/optical-materials/thin-glass/cover-glass-d-263-m/index.html)

Some vendors also make glass bottom dishes and plates with these
coverslips - please see our [list of dish
