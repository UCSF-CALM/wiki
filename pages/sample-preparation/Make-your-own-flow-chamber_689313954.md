Did you know you can make your own flow chamber slide with some
double-sided tape?

Here is an example of making a simple flow chamber with double-sided
tape, a razor blade (to cut tape), a coverslip, and a slide.

This chamber is a good example of one that allows you to add while
imaging!

[![Sketch of the flow chamber. A glass coverslip, smeared with
nitrocellulose, is attached onto a microscope slide through double
sticky tape stripes to form a flow-cell of about 20 ml volume. Solutions
are flown from one side of the chamber with a pipette and sucked from
the other side through a filter paper to create a flow in the arrow
direction.](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/335370438/figure/fig1/AS:802347861159942@1568306045509/Sketch-of-the-flow-chamber-A-glass-coverslip-smeared-with-nitrocellulose-is-attached.png)

mm between one ethanol vapor-cleaned and PLL-PEG-treated glass and one
biotin-PEG-functionalized glass coverslip. (b) Cartoon of the

microtubule seed is immobilized via NeutrAvidin on functionalized glass
and allowed to grow dynamically in the presence of free nonbiotinylated
tubulin and GTP in the solution. Imaging is performed with dual-color,
time-lapse TIRF
microscopy.](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ivo_Telley/publication/51506573/figure/fig2/AS:667872732930064@1536244676645/Scheme-of-the-flow-cell-and-the-setup-a-Scheme-of-the-flow-chamber-Two-strips-of.png)
