# Dyes for 405nm excitation

This is a summary of information Kurt Thorn collected in 2007 for dyes
that could be used with 405 nm laser excitation.

Molecular Probes has some nice options that fill this niche (for a
general overview see [the
Handbook](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/molecular-probes-the-handbook.html)):

 Dye Excitation Emission
 ----------------- ------------ ----------
 Alexa Fluor 405 402nm 421nm
 Pacific Blue 410nm 455nm
 Pacific Orange 405nm 551nm
 Cascade Yellow 410nm 550nm

\

The Alexa 405 and Pacific Blue dyes should work well with the existing
blue channel on our confocals; with the Pacific Orange and Cascade
Yellow dyes it may be possible to use the 405nm laser excitation with
green detection enabling multiplexing.

All of these are available as antibody conjugates except Cascade Yellow.
For a table of available antibody conjugates, see
[here](https://www.thermofisher.com/us/en/home/references/molecular-probes-the-handbook/tables/summary-of-molecular-probes-secondary-antibody-conjugates.html).

[Atto
425](https://www.atto-tec.com/attotecshop/product_info.php?info=p4_ATTO-425.html&XTCsid=ucvoaehx) outperforms Pacific Blue and Alexa 405 as phalloidin
conjugates under 405 nm excitation (Eric Griffis, U. Dundee, on Confocal
listserv).

[CF405S](http://www.biotium.com/product/product_info/Newproduct/CF405S_Dye.asp "http://www.biotium.com/product/product_info/Newproduct/CF405S_Dye.asp"), from Biotium, has a similar spectrum to Alexa 405, and
is available as additional conjugates, and so may also be a good option
for some experiments. Their
[CF405M](http://www.biotium.com/product/product_info/Newproduct/CF405M_Dye.asp "http://www.biotium.com/product/product_info/Newproduct/CF405M_Dye.asp") is a Pacific Blue substitute.

[Dylight
405](http://www.piercenet.com/browse.cfm?fldID=F8FAC387-ED6D-0790-D3DE-F2132291EE18) is another Alexa 405 substitute.

[Brilliant
violet](http://www.biolegend.com/brilliantviolet "http://www.biolegend.com/brilliantviolet") is a new dye in this spectral region that claims to be
much brighter.

- Note: We have had some users test BV421 with with decent success.
 Always better if it is a more prominant signal and on a more sensitive
 camera (i.e. EMCCD)
