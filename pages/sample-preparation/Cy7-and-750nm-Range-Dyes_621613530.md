## Dyes people have used successfully on our systems

- Alexa fluor 750
- Phalloidin 750

## Tips

- Detectors tend to be less sensitive in the longer wavelengths. Put
 your brightest most abundant protein in that channel!

## Mounting Media Considerations

Thanks to the hard work by Helene Foussard, PhD in Nevan Krogan\'s lab,
we have found that Alexa Fluor 750nm is quenched by vectashield.

Helene ran some quick tests for non-hardening mounting media and these
were the results:

- [Ibidi mounting medium- Bleached, but bleached the
 slowest
- [Ever Bright from Biotium- Bleached, but better than Slow Fade
 Gold
- Slow Fade Gold from Thermo - didn\'t seem to quench beforehand, but
 bleached Quickly.
- [Vectasheild - Quenched before imaging\
