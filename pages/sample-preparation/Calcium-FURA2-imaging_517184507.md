title: Calcium-FURA2 imaging
author: Delaine Larsen
---

Fura-2 is a UV light--excitable, ratiometric Ca2+ indicator and became
most common dye of choice for ratio-imaging microscopy, where it is more
practical to change excitation wavelengths than emission wavelengths.
Upon binding Ca2+, Fura 2 exhibits an absorption shift that can be
observed by scanning the excitation spectrum between 300 and 400 nm,
while monitoring the emission at \~510 nm. Fura 2 shows comparably good
photostability

**Fura-2** is a widely used UV-excitable fluorescent calcium indicator.
Upon calcium binding, the fluorescent excitation maximum of the
indicator undergoes a blue shift from 363 nm (Ca2+-free) to 335 nm
(Ca2+-saturated), while the fluorescence emission maximum is relatively
unchanged at \~510 nm.

**Further Information on fura-2**

Fura 2 was developed to improve the fluorescent properties of Quin 2.
The signal intensity in 1 mM of loaded Fura 2 corresponds to that of 30
mM of loaded Quin 2. This characteristic allows an experiment at a lower
concentration of indicator using Fura-2 as compared to Quin 2. Fura 2 is
one of the most widely used calcium indicators for ratiometric
measurement. As a result, many types of instrumentation are now
available for experiments using Fura 2. Fura-2 is highly suitable for
digital imaging microscopy. It is less susceptible to photo-bleaching
than Indo 1. Changes in the cell shape can sometimes affect the
fluorescent ratio at 340 nm and 380 nm. For example, fluorescent signal
intensities at these wavelengths sometimes decrease simultaneously with
smooth muscle contraction. For blood vessels, however, the increase of
the signal intensity at 340 nm tends to be smaller on contraction, while
the decrease of the signal intensity at 380 nm tends to be larger with
its contraction. Fura 2-AM is an acetoxymethyl ester derivative of Fura
2 that can be easily loaded into cells by incubation.\
 

**General fura-2 Protocol**

General Protocol (for NG 108-15/ Neuronal Cell Line)\*\
Reagents:\
1 mM Fura 2-AM/DMSO (1 mg Fura 2-AM in 1 ml DMSO)\
Hanks·balanced salt solution (HBSS)\
HEPES buffer saline (20 mM HEPES, 115 mM NaCl, 5.4 mM KCl, 1.8 mM CaCl2,
0.8 mM MgCl2, 13.8 mM glucose, pH 7.4)\
Protocol:\
1. Culture cells on a glass-bottom dish using DMEM containing 5% fetal
calf serum.\
2. Change the medium to 1 mM dibutyl cAMP/DMEM, and culture the cells
for 3-4 days to induce dendrites.\
3. Dilute 1 mM Fura 2-AM DMSO solution with HEPES buffer saline to
prepare 1 mM Fura 2-AM working solution.\
4. Remove the culture medium, and add 0.5 ml of the Fura 2-AM working
solution to the cells.\
5. Incubate for 20 min. Then remove the Fura 2-AM working solution.\
6. Wash the cells once with HEPES buffer saline. Then incubate the cells
for 1 hour in the HEPES buffer saline.\
7. Use the cells for fluorescent calcium ion detection.\
8. Monitor the excitation spectra at 380 nm (calcium free) and 340 nm
(calcium complex) with fixed emission at 510 nm.\
\*Cell staining conditions differ by cell types, so it is necessary to
optimize the conditions for each experiment.
