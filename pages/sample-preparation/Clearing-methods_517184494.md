title: Clearing methods

Imaging of thick (\>50 um) tissue sections is often improved by clearing
of the samples - treating them so that the normally opaque sample
becomes clear. In 2007, we tested a number of clearing methods in
conjunction with Nan Tang. The results are summarized in this [white
paper](http://nic.ucsf.edu/dokuwiki/lib/exe/fetch.php?media=mounting_media_tests.pdf "mounting_media_tests.pdf (2 MB)"){.external-link
rel="nofollow"}. Since then, other clearing methods have been published:

- [Passive Clarity
  (PACT)](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867414009313 "http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0092867414009313"){.external-link
  rel="nofollow"} clearing has been used successfully by a number of
  UCSF labs.

- The [Scale
  protocol](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21878933 "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21878933"){.external-link
  rel="nofollow"} has been published by the Miyawaki lab, which uses 4M
  urea to render whole mouse embryos essentially transparent.

- A [recent
  paper](http://www.plosone.org/article/info%3Adoi%2F10.1371%2Fjournal.pone.0033916){.external-link
  rel="nofollow"} shows that dehydration with tetrahydrofuran and
  clearing with dibenzyl ether preserves GFP fluorescence better than
  ethanol dehydration and clearing with BABB.

- [CLARITY](http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v497/n7449/full/nature12107.html "http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v497/n7449/full/nature12107.html"){.external-link
  rel="nofollow"} uses electrophoresis with SDS to clear very thick
  brain tissue.

- [SeeDB](http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v16/n8/full/nn.3447.html "http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v16/n8/full/nn.3447.html"){.external-link
  rel="nofollow"} uses fructose and thioglycerol to clear tissue and
  appears to work about as well as Scale.

- Here is a [detailed
  protocol](http://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/content/2012/9/pdb.prot069625.full "http://cshprotocols.cshlp.org/content/2012/9/pdb.prot069625.full"){.external-link
  rel="nofollow"} for fixing and mounting dragonfly tissue in 2,2-TDE.

- [3DISCO](http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v7/n11/full/nprot.2012.119.html "http://www.nature.com/nprot/journal/v7/n11/full/nprot.2012.119.html"){.external-link
  rel="nofollow"} uses tissue dehydration in THF and clearing with
  dibenzyl ether. It clears quickly and is at least somewhat compatible
  with GFP.

- [Citifluor](http://www.citifluor.com/non_hardening_antifadents.php "http://www.citifluor.com/non_hardening_antifadents.php"){.external-link
  rel="nofollow"} mounting media are supposed to clear well (Confocal
  Listserv post from Sean Speese, 10/22/2013).

  rel="nofollow"}covering current clearing methods and imaging cleared
  tissues

- Here is a [2021 Nature
  protocols](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41596-021-00502-8){.external-link
  rel="nofollow"} paper that cover tips and practical considerations for
  tissue clearing and imaging

Info from users

- A user using CUBIC had trouble with long-term imaging in an open
  cuvette because the CUBIC crystalized overnight
