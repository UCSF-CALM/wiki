We were asked if we could image this ratio metric reporter protein in
our lab by Lin Yuan from David Julius\'s Lab

\

After testing different configurations on the time-lapse microscope, the
following gave the most light for each channel without moving a
dichroic:

Perceval Channel 440 (ADP)

- LED: 440nm (FF01-445/40-25-STR)
- Emission: FF01-525/30-25 (Semrock)
- Dichroic: CFP/YFP (86002bs Chroma)

Perceval Channel 480 (ATP)

- LED: 480nm (FF01-480/40-25-STR)
- Emission: FF01-525/30-25 (Semrock)
- Dichroic: CFP/YFP (86002bs Chroma)

\

Control: [metabolic inhibitor cocktail]{olk-copy-source="MessageBody"}

Lin reported success! We are now waiting for the paper
