# Protocols for Immunocytochemistry in cell culture

## Below are some general protocols for standing from members of the core

There are many small variations in staining, so keep in mind that, as
with any protocol, you may need to optimize the below protocols for your
needs.

Many companies have resources on staining that may be helpful to check
out
