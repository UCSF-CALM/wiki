# Sample preparation for SIM imaging

Structured Illumination (SIM) imaging is extremely sensitive to
spherical aberration. To get the highest quality images (or even to get
proper reconstruction), you need to minimize spherical aberration. This
means:

- You should use [high precision 0.17 mm
 coverslips](High-Precision-Coverslips.html)

- You should mount in an appropriate mounting medium. Nikon recommends
 mounting either in
 [2,2-thiodiethanol](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17131355 "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17131355") or in [Prolong
 Gold](http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/brands/Molecular-Probes/Key-Molecular-Probes-Products/ProLong-Antifades-Brand-Page.html "http://www.invitrogen.com/site/us/en/home/brands/Molecular-Probes/Key-Molecular-Probes-Products/ProLong-Antifades-Brand-Page.html") or newer equivalent (for a hard-set mounting medium).
 If using Prolong Gold, be aware of potential shrinkage when it cures.

 - Note: Hardset mounting mediums will flatten out your sample! See
 figre below.

 - DO NOT USE Fluoromount G. We have had people try this. It does not
 work.

 - DO NOT USE use mounting medium which contains DAPI or other
 fluorophores.

 - You should have your sample as close to the coverslip as possible
 (e.g. cells grown on coverslip not on slide).

 - you should use bright and stable fluorophores.
