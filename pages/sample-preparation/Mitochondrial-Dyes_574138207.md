## PK Mito Orange   

We were generously able to try this dye thanks to Dr.
[Zhixing[Chen!

- Notes from people imaging:
  - Works great in the RFP/Red channel
  - Tested with Live STED we have found this dye to be incredibly stable
    and super bright!
    - Note if you stress your cells out you will see if go to the ER
      (this is true of all mito dyes)
  - Works great on the SoRa!\
    - SoRa is sure bleachy and toxic to cells, we found the cell will
      probably die from the SoRa\'s Power before the dye will bleach
    - So far with short exposures we have been able to do time lapses
      and Z stacks (not both)
  - Even though it is designed as a super-resolution dye it is
    incredibly stable and can be used with other imaging
