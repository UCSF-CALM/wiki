title: Plates and dishes for imaging

For best quality imaging, you want to use a 170 μm (0.17 mm) coverslip.
This is roughly equivalent to a #1.5 coverslip. There are also plate and
dish options which use a plastic polymer instead of a coverslip. When
choosing a polymer bottom pay attention to the thickness of the polymer,
since anything thicker that a coverslip will reduce the working distance
of the objective and can prevent you from using high NA objectives. Also
standard PS tissue culture plasticware can be imaged through but you
will not have good performance and is really only acceptable if you just
need low resolution images. The following are sources of imaging dishes
and plates we are aware of.

 Coverglass](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/155361PK?ICID=search-product) and [Lab-Tek II Chambered Coverglass (#1.5
 coverslip)](https://www.thermofisher.com/order/catalog/product/155379?ICID=search-product)

- [ibidi](https://ibidi.com/13-chambered-coverslips)

 - Has ibidi polymer bottom or glass bottom (#1.5H, 170um +/- 5um)
 options

 - also has 18 well options on a single slide!

- [Cellvis](http://www.cellvis.com/products.php "http://www.cellvis.com/products.php") (formerly In Vitro Scientific) also realitively in
 expensive and good - reported to us to be cheaper than mat tek

 - Has 18 well options on a single slide!
 - Cell vis also now sells single Well 96 well format dishes

- [Greiner Bio-One CELLview
 Slide](https://shop.gbo.com/en/usa/articles/catalogue/articles/0110_0110_0130_0020/ "https://shop.gbo.com/en/usa/articles/catalogue/articles/0110_0110_0130_0020/")

 - New product with coverslip bottom and detachable block

- [Eppendorf](https://online-shop.eppendorf.com/OC-en/Cell-Culture-and-Imaging-Consumables-110320/Cell-Imaging-Consumables-120210/Eppendorf-Cell-Imaging-Slides-and-Coverglasses-PF-19455.html "https://online-shop.eppendorf.com/OC-en/Cell-Culture-and-Imaging-Consumables-110320/Cell-Imaging-Consumables-120210/Eppendorf-Cell-Imaging-Slides-and-Coverglasses-PF-19455.html")

 - Dimensions of the Eppendorf product is slightly larger than the Nunc
 Lab-Tek coverglasses which means that it will not fit in any of our
 OkoLab stage inserts sized for Lab-Tek. The dimensions might be
 changed in the future so double check the size before purchasing.

- NOTE: [MatTek is popular for 35mm, but the Chambered Slides they sell
 are NOT able to be viewed through the bottom (they have a 1mm
 thickness) and should not be used for live imaging. You must remove
 wells and coverslip these
 slides.]

#### Multi-well plates

There are a large number of multi-well plates designed for imaging
available that vary in cost, mostly determined by the material the
bottom of the plate is made of. There are some important details to pay
attention to when deciding on a plate to make sure that you will be able
to capture the images needed for your experiments. In general you want a
flat-bottom plate with black sides to help keep low background
fluorescence and light scattering minimized.

1. Glass bottom vs Polymer bottom- Glass bottom plates will give the
 best performance and should be used if you plan on using a 40x or
 higher magnification objective. For standard screening the polymer
 bottom plates can provide good performance at a lower cost but pay
 attention to the thickness of the polymer. Some polymers can be more
 than 300 um thick, which will limit the objectives that can be used
 due to working distance issues.

2. Height of plate skirt -- Plates with a tall skirt can prevent you
 from focusing on the edge wells with some objectives. If you need to
 use a higher NA objective be sure to test your plate to make sure
 that you can access the edge wells. Several manufactures have plates
 available with almost no skirt.

- The Vale lab recommends these plates from
 [Brooks](https://www.brookslifesciences.com/product-micro/pcr-microplate-consumables-instruments?f%5B0%5D=range_micro%3A1141)

#### Specialty Products

- [Coylab makes an interesting gas permeable
 plate](https://coylab.com/products/gas-permeable-plates/) with a fluoropolymer bottom that is very thin (10
 microns) and low refractive index (1.34). It may have interesting
 applications beyond gas permeability, such as using water dipping
 objectives for imaging.

- [Sarstedt](https://www.sarstedt.com/en/products/laboratory/cell-tissue-culture/lumox-technology/ "https://www.sarstedt.com/en/products/laboratory/cell-tissue-culture/lumox-technology/") has Lumox product line (multi-well plates and petri
 dishes) which has a gas-permeable film base that is 50 um thick.

Many companies can provide a sample of the different dishes and plates.
If you are unsure of what you need this can be useful for a way to test
performance of the plates on your samples.
