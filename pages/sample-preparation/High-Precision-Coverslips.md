# High Precision Coverslips

Microscope objectives, in general, are designed to work with 0.17 mm
coverslips. You will get the best image quality using coverslips of
exactly this thickness. Using coverslips of the wrong thickness will
induce [spherical
aberration](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_aberration "http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spherical_aberration").

There are now a number of sources for high precision (0.17 +/- 0.005 mm)
coverslips:

- [Azer
 Scientific](https://www.azerscientific.com/life-sciences/glassware-plasticware/cover-glasses/specialty?page=1) - A variety of coverslip sizes are available.

- [Zeiss](https://www.micro-shop.zeiss.com/en/de/shop/search/Cover%20glasses,%20high%20performance,)

- [Applied
