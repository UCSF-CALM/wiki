## Reservation calendars

The reservation calendars for all the microscopes are on iLab. The
landing page for access to all microscope calendars
is [https://ucsf.ilab.agilent.com/service_center/5226/?tab=equipment](https://ucsf.ilab.agilent.com/service_center/5226/?tab=equipment)

## Setting up an Account

If you don't have an iLab account detailed directions for setting up an
account can be found on the [RRP
website](https://rrp.ucsf.edu/ilab). The
basic steps for setting up a new account are as follows:

1. Create your iLab Account at
 [https://ucsf.ilab.agilent.com](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__ucsf.ilab.agilent.com&d=DwMCaQ&c=iORugZls2LlYyCAZRB3XLg&r=lw4MOd9m3q5M3UOsAg0Hyy75-XslxV0PinoSDfo-fuI&m=FX2pWutK2vEVOnZz1wQsiyL0ywYDnApNXk7yjvApdJs&s=oEdhyowbDxRfEDWIEQPTk8GU3kMl3AqX26y-ABFoeZ4&e=)
2. Request to be added to your PI
3. Ask your PI to assign you to funding sources (This step has to be
 done by the PI or someone assigned as a Lab Manager)
 1.  The directions for assigning speedtypes are on the RRP website
 ([https://rrp.ucsf.edu/managing-lab](https://rrp.ucsf.edu/managing-lab)) and the changes are made immediately.

\

The calendars are restricted to trained users and access is granted
after a training session.

## Reasons why filling out the training request fails

- ### BUA

 - One of the starred regions is not filled out (most often the BUA

 - [

\

- ### The form has not been saved

 - If the is not complete or hasn\'t been fully saved, it will appear
 red
 - [

<!-- -->

- - Tor Fix open up the form and go to the bottom of the form and click
 \"save completed form\"
 - [

\

- ### No Payment information/No Speedtype

 - The cost is 0, but you still need to select the speed type you would
 like to use under payment information.

<!-- -->

- - [

\

- ### The form was saved, but the request at the bottom was not clicked

 - There are two different save buttons! Please remember to click
 submit request to core at the bottom!
 - [

### To get back into your requar to check

- You can go back in to your request in iLab and check for all of these
 things by clicking on the blue arrow next to the request.

\

[

The only thing that will now change is the selection of the speed type
will happen after you select the submit button, which is now at the top
if that is the problem
