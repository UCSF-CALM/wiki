## Troubleshooting Tips:

### Trapping laser won\'t turn on

- If the system has not been used in a few days or more than the lasers
 may need some time to warm up!
 - Tip: always turn the key first while you set up to give them as much
 time as possible
 - Wait an extra few minutes (5-10min) if you did not turn it on first
 thing.
- Do a full restart

\

### Condenser won\'t move

- It is likely stuck in a state. The whole system needs to be restarted.

\

### Whole system restart

- Lower the Objective
- Turn off the system computer
 - Turn off software first. Save anything you do not want to get lost.
 - Turn off from  Windows Start menu
 - Bridge computer can stay on
- Turn off Trapping laser
 - Turn Key
- Turn off Main power Supply
- WAIT 3 min (set a timer if needed)
- Turn on main power supply
 - A high-pitched noise is normal as a few of the components will reset
 to default \"home positions\"
- Turn on the system computer
 - This is the box below the main power supply,
 - There is a door with a key, you need to open the door then flip the
 switch
- Turn on the trapping  laser
