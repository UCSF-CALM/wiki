# PSFs and aberrations

A paper describing an aberration resulting from imaging with a water
objective through a tilted coverslip; the aberration is apparent for
less than one degree of tilt. [Arimoto and Murray, \"A common aberration
with water-immersion objective lenses.\" J Microsc. 2004 Oct;216(Pt
1):49-51.](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15369482 "http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15369482")
